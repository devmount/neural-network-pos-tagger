# Master Thesis
**Part-of-Speech Tagging with Neural Networks for a conversational agent**

This master thesis aims to improve the natural language understanding of an artificial conversational agent, that uses a Hidden Markov Model to calculate Part-of-Speech tags for input words. In order to achieve better results especially for uncommon word combinations and sentence structures, two new classification models are implemented and evaluated: a Feed-forward Neural Network and a Recurrent Neural Network.
